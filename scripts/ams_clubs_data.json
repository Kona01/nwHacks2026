We acknowledge their ancestors who nourished the land for centuries before it was stolen.

We encourage you to learn more about their work and how to contribute. Who are we? UBC Mountain Bike Club was (re)established in the Fall of 2022 by a few passionate mountain bikers at UBC. The club started as a group chat with some friends who wanted a fellow community of bikers. In time, we have grown into an official UBC club with over 75 members. Each of us are at different levels of riding, we have different backgrounds and experiences, but we are connected through our appreciation of the outdoors and our love for riding bikes! We organize bike rides, social events, and mountain bike trips for our members. All are welcome in our space."

Check us out in the basement of the Life Building, room 36.

We host weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 6:00 pm in IKB 261 and each meeting focuses on a specific stage of applying for dental schools and becoming a competitive applicant. This includes going over the application process of various Canadian dental schools, with very specific details for UBC’s faculty of dentistry. We also go over the DAT, PAT, MMI, and SGI, all the steps that each applicant needs to successfully complete to get into the majority of dental schools. We have speakers from organizations that provide resources and discount codes to our members, such as DAT Crusher, DAT Bootcamp, and OzTREKK. We host monthly socials and term events to build a sense of community for our members where they will have the opportunity to network and meet others with the same aspirations. We have panels where we are joined by dental professionals and dental students who share their journeys and answer the various questions our members have.  Our club also strives to fortify and expand our connections with our local community by opening up volunteer and leadership positions for our members and collaborating with other local organizations. To become a member please visit our Instagram @ubcpredent or email us at ubcpredent@gmail.com for steps to purchase a membership!"

Membership fees are $75 per semester, or $130 for the Sept 2025 - April 2026 year. We offer three levels at each practice: Gold, Silver, and Blue. Gold and Silver are for more experienced swimmers, with practices styled like competitive practices, but with less intensity. Blue is designed for those with no formal swimming experience, with goals to improve your swimming abilities and techniques with the help of our coaches! Our only requirement is that you must be able to swim 50m without stopping. (see our instagram page for sample practices and additional information) In addition to swimming, we make sure that this is a social club too! We host a few socials each semester, from going to hockey games together to hosting pizza-fueled trivia nights after practice. This is a one-stop-shop for both friends and fitness! This club is home to many new swimmers who are looking for a welcoming place to start, and plenty of ex-competitive swimmers who want to keep swimming routinely in University. We'd love to welcome all of you to our club. See you on deck!"

It is more important now than ever for the UBC student community to engage in the learning and solving of quantum computing problems. We provide hands-on workshops and 1-on-1 mentorship to help students navigate available resources (with a focus on application), explore their interests, and accelerate their abilities in quantum computing. Peer-facilitated learning and co-working sessions are organized to support members in developing their own projects in quantum computing (albeit for fun or for future aspirations). We partner with companies, organizations, and research institutes to host seminars and industry nights to expose members to field-leading research and employment opportunities. We strive to cultivate an equitable and diverse future quantum workforce, today! If you are interested, please feel free to reach out - we would love to discuss what UBC Quantum Club can do for you!"

Being a historical club at UBC, we trace our heritage and often meet with club execs from the 1990s, whom many are now members of Metro Vancouver Taiwan Professional Elite, and we provide much job-related information in various industries for our members. Acknowledging our privilege of studying at UBC, we give back to Taiwanese and Canadian society by holding UBC application info sessions for immigration school kids, also sharing our experiences in National Taiwan University."

Therefore, the purpose of the AMS Women’s Health Club is to provide a safe, accessible space to support, encourage, and hype-up female-identifying students as they pursue their health and fitness-related goals. We believe in helping every woman learn and develop a healthy lifestyle that aligns with their personal goals to help them live a balanced lifestyle as they take on challenges to reach their fullest personal and professional potential. We aim to bring together and support female-identifying students from all fields of study at UBC to improve our member’s wellness through group fitness classes, networking socials and awareness events."

CIN aims to transform how students approach their passions by sharing the practical skills and knowledge that students need to succeed in their creative industry of interest as entrepreneurs. Through events, online resources, alumni mentorship, and connections with industry professionals, we aim to equip UBC students with the knowledge and confidence to break into the creative industries. The club started with a focus on four major industries, being Music, Dance, Film and Visual Arts. But we’ve since then diversified our focus to include more industries including Fashion, Beauty, Media, Graphic Design and Theatre and are continuing to highlight other niches of interest. By collaborating with local UBC and Vancouver-based talent, we nurture connections with industry professionals that allow us to develop and share with students the business resources necessary to launch careers in creative industries globally."

Our advocacy events aim to educate the UBC community on global humanitarian issues, including the work MSF carries out across the world. This is done through boothing, panels, and solidarity walks. We also incorporate advocacy internally by holding bi-weekly global affairs discussions where a member of the team presents a specific MSF assignment and comes up with discussion questions for us to reflect on. Our fundraising events aim to raise funds for the club so that we can continue putting on events as well as raise funds for MSF to support their life saving humanitarian work."

The GRSJUA attempts to encompass social justice in multiple forms—hosting social, academic, peer-support, and mutual aid events, in addition to offering club advocacy for equity initiatives on and off campus. We operate from an ethos of radical creativity, imagination, liberation, and joy. We aim to provide an accessible, open and community orientated space for students from all different backgrounds, disciplines and lived experiences to interact with social justice in a meaningful way. The GRSJUA does not charge membership fees, a majority of our events are free, and all students are welcome to join!"

Whether through volunteering, planning fun social events for our members, or expanding outreach efforts, we believe in showing love and kindness to our neighbours, all while building a strong, supportive community within our club. Our club was inspired by Agapé Street Ministry, a catholic group which provides street outreach in Downtown, and Mrs. Ellen Shonsta, popularly known as \"Mom\", was a part of it. Ellen Shonsta delivered food to the houseless people in Vancouver, despite being confined to a scooter due to arthritis. \"When you make a connection with someone who has no one, it changes his life because he realizes he's worthy,\" says Ellen. \"And this changes your life because you have changed his.\" In the past we have been funded by groups like Pepsi Refresh Everything Fund, Safeway, Vancouver Arbutus Rotary Club, Walter H Gage Memorial Funds, and others. We are incredibly grateful for their support and we look forward to more sponsorships so that we can reach more people and make a meaningful difference in the community."

As students take all of their courses at BCIT for their second and third years in a cohort-manner, it is important to foster relations between those in each cohort, as well as between cohorts. Thus, this club serves to hold events and foster relations within and between cohorts. Furthermore, to introduce biotechnology students to the prospective jobs that they may choose to venture into in the future, the Biotechnology club hopes to connect said students, as well as others interested in the field of biotechnology, with company representatives at our annual Biotechnology Networking Night event. Students that are in the Honours in Biotechnology program are automatically enrolled as members in the Biotechnology Club. Members are informed first about upcoming events, participate in socials (ex. Annual Biotechnology BBQ), and are allowed to vote for executive members."

Trips run from the beginner-friendly to the expert-only and everything in-between. Feel free to read on here, but if you like what you hear please do visit our website ! What does the VOC do? Members run trips basically every weekend, year round. VOC members post on our trip agenda , message board, and Discord server to plan all kinds of trips. You’re encouraged to sign up and come along. If you have somewhere you want to go, put up your own trip! Trips are free, you’ll have to chip in for gas and buy your own food but that’s basically it! We also maintain a number of back country huts for use by the larger outdoor community. And, you can rent gear from the clubroom for a small, refundable deposit during these times . For lots more information about the club, check out our WIKI ! What does membership do for me? How much does it cost? A year long membership costs $45 for UBC students and $70 for everyone else. To get a membership, sign up at Clubs’ Days or drop by the clubroom during the gear hours. Alternatively, fill out the membership form linked at the bottom of this page at anytime and come by the clubroom during gear hours with your membership cash. We promise we are working on online payment, it’s just not ready yet. Your membership fee gets you: Access to member run trips The ability to borrow gear for free Access to our library of maps, guidebooks, and other outdoor literature A VOC journal, detailing trip stories of the year Access to the VOC message board with more trips, cheap gear, tons of information, and conversations about the outdoors … and so much more! What if I’m new to the outdoor scene? The VOC is made up of a large number of students with varying degrees of outdoor experience. While many of our trips are quite challenging, a large dose of enthusiasm can often make up for a lack of experience, and there are many trips posted that are not as challenging and do not require much – or any – experience. Keep an eye out for informal “schools,” designed to help beginners develop skills and beginner friendly trips which are geared towards novices and learning. Outdoors people of all skill and experience levels are encouraged to join! Where is the VOC located? You can find us in the basement of the AMS Nest . Drop by on your lunch break and hang out to talk about your latest trip or to plan your next one. SIGN UP NOTE: If you make a new account, you won’t be able to log in until you have paid your membership dues ($45) and then your account will be immediately activated."

Through workshops, collaborative projects, and professional guidance, members will develop skills such as vocal modulation, character creation, and audio storytelling. The club also promotes an appreciation for the uniqueness of voice art, encouraging students to experiment with diverse styles and techniques, from animation dubbing to audiobook narration. By fostering an environment of creativity and collaboration, the Voice Acting Club aims to nurture not only professional growth but also meaningful friendships among members who share a love for this distinctive and powerful art form."
